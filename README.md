## PHP_SUS
PHP Simple-managable Url Shortener | CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete)
<p>Demo site: https://url.craftverse.shop</p>

> Demo creds,
> Username: `guest`
> Password: `guest`

## How to setup?
1. Import the `url.sql` to your phpmyadmin/mysql database
2. Put all the files to your `htdocs`
3. Go to the folder named `core` and open `config.php` fill it up with your credentials.
4. Login using default creds Username: `ninja` Password: `ninja123`
#### Note: In changing password you need to md5 hash it like this `ninja_linkz:new_password`

## How does shortener works without seeing parameter from url?
if you download this repository and go to the folder named `z` you will see a file named `.htaccess` and below are the content inside that `.htaccess`

```
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond $1 !^(index\.php|images|robots\.txt)
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ./index.php?code=$1 [L]
```
this means that using `.htaccess` to forward any subdirectory before /z/ subdirectory from the url to `index.php?code=` to be read as a code.
